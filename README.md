# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Purpose

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn, enabling businesses to implement targeted retention strategies. By identifying customers likely to leave, companies can take proactive measures to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a churn prediction model using historical customer data. The model was designed to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Role

**Machine Learning Engineer**

## Responsibilities

1. Researched and identified effective methodologies for predicting customer churn, focusing on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
2. Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed historical customer data to ensure data quality and relevance.
3. Engineered features and built classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost, to accurately predict customer churn.
4. Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix, and provided actionable insights for enhancing customer retention strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Database:** SQL
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Details

### Data Preprocessing

- Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values.
- Performed feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the model.
- Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features.

### Model Development

- Built and compared several classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Model Evaluation

- Evaluated models using cross-validation, accuracy scores, and confusion matrices.
- Selected the best-performing model based on testing accuracy and overall stability.

### Insights and Recommendations

- Provided insights into the factors contributing to customer churn.
- Suggested actionable strategies for improving customer retention based on model predictions.

## How to Use

1. **Data Input:**
   - Input customer data in the specified format.
   - Ensure data is cleaned and preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Use the provided Python scripts to train the model on your dataset.
   - Adjust hyperparameters as needed to fit your data.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Run the prediction script to identify customers likely to churn.
   - Utilize the model outputs to inform your customer retention strategies.
